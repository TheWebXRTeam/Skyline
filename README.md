# Skyline

Social media doesnâ€™t have to be an endless scrolling stream. It can be delightful, physical and fun. We invite you to come on this journey with us and explore a future rich with friendly data.

Skyline is a new kind of social media, built on the open source AT protocol. Currently Skyline pulls in data from Bluesky. A more advanced implementation may be self hosted and enable rich media and interaction, including 3D models, minigames, music and so much more-- all in your browser.
